# Project: Kattenkwaad

A simple website that allows you to find cat sitters, and filter them on your area and the maximum price you are willing to pay per hour.

## General Information

Going on a holiday? Don’t want to leave your cats alone? Don’t have neighbours who you’d trust with your lovely feline? Often the next step is visiting a ‘holiday shelter’, where they take care of your feline companion for you. However, after a visit to one of these shelters I decided I’d rather cancel my holiday than leave my cat there. Often a number of cats share a small space, and the constant meowing (and barking of the dog shelter next door) didn’t give me the feeling that my cats would be happy there. Hence, I embarked on a internet search for a cat sitter. Most catsitters have their own site, which made comparing them difficult. This is where my website comes in handy: simply make an account, view the cat-sitters who have registered, and send them an email if you’re interested!
